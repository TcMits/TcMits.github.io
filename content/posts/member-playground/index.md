# Member Playground
---

The Member Playground project created a playground for merchants and customers, where customers can earn points by participating in various activities such as making purchases and sharing products on social media. These points can then be used to pay for real orders, creating a win-win situation for both customers and merchants.

As a backend developer, I worked on the Member Playground project, which involved creating two mobile apps and a web app. The goal of the project was to create a playground for merchants and customers, where customers could create orders and earn points that could be used to pay for real orders.

The Member Playground project was developed using Django and Django Rest Framework. The database was built on Postgres and PostGis, which provided geospatial capabilities for location-based services. Redis was used for caching and session management. Nginx was used as a reverse proxy to handle incoming requests. The project was deployed using Docker and Docker Compose in the testing and staging environments, and Docker Swarm in production.

The Member Playground project had three types of application servers: the Customer server, which handled customer traffic such as confirming orders, introducing friends, and looking for nearby stores; the Merchant server, which handled merchant traffic such as creating orders, searching members, and asking for points; and the Admin server, which handled staff traffic such as confirming images, increasing points, and decreasing points.

The Member Playground project was a challenging but rewarding project to work on. It required a deep understanding of both the technical and business requirements of the project. I was responsible for designing and implementing the backend architecture, as well as integrating it with the frontend. Through my contributions to the project, we were able to create a playground that provided customers with a fun and engaging experience, while also providing merchants with a valuable tool for driving sales and customer loyalty.
